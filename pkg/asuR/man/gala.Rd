\title{Species diversity on the Galapagos Islands}
\description{There are 30 Galapagos islands and 7 variables in the
  dataset. The relationship between the number of plant species
  and several geographic variables is of interest. The original
  dataset contained several missing values which have been filled
  for convenience.
